## Requirements for the Project
a) Implement "The Menace" by replacing the matchboxes with values in a dictionary.

b) Train the Menace by running games played against "human" strategy, which is based upon optimal strategy.

c) You will need to choose values for:

    • alpha (the number of "beads" to in each "matchbox" at the start of the game—may be different for each move)
    
    • beta (the number of "beads" to add to the "matchbox" in the event of a win)
    
    • gamma (the number of "beads" to take to the "matchbox" in the event of a loss)
    
    • delta (the number of "beads" to add to the "matchbox" in the event of a draw)
    
d) Implement logging with date/time, win/loss/draw, and p.

e) Run unit tests, showing the date/time.
